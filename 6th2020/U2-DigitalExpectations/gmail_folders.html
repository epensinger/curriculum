<h1 id="toc_0">Labels for Gmail</h1>

<h2 id="toc_1">STRONGLY recommended</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">Old</h3>

<ul>
<li>this is for any emails before this year</li>
<li>at the end of each school year/start of a new year, you should take all the previous years emails and dump them in here.</li>
<li>you can still access them by searching, but they are out of the way</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">Classes</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is for any emails related to classes - class work, class information, etc.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t need to make a label for each class because you can simply search by teacher</li>
<li>You may make a label inside (nested) of the Classes label for any of the classes you want to.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_4">School Info</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is for Announcements and school information that isn&#39;t related to a particular class</li>
<li>You will put any information about your grade in here (trips, info from class oficers, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_5">Other or Miscelaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is or stuff you want to keep that doesn&#39;t fit your other labels. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_6">Optional Labels</h2>

<ul>
<li>you might need or want these other labels depending on your situation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_7">Companies</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you find yourself keeping a lot of emails from companies, you may want to keep them in a separate label.</li>
<li>I wouldn&#39;t make a separate label for each company because you can search for specific companies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">Sports</h3>

<ul>
<li>This label might be &quot;Football&quot; for you or &quot;Soccer&quot; or whatever you play.</li>
<li>You also may want to just have one sports label and put all your sports related stuff in it.</li>
<li>This is a spot for emails related to your sport - from coaches, athletic department, maybe parents? Anything to do with sports, put it here.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_9">Theater</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you are involved in theater and have emails related to it, make a label so you can find them all quickly.</li>
<li>Obviously, if you aren&#39;t in theater, you wouldn&#39;t have this folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_10">Robotics</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you are in robotics, you would want to have a place for emails about it.</li>
<li>If you aren&#39;t in robotics, you wouldn&#39;t need this folder.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_11">Other clubs/activities</h3>

<ul>
<li>I hope you notice a pattern.  If you are in any other club or activity that you get emails about, make a label for it.</li>
<li>If you are in a service or leadership group, you would want to have a label to keep all those things organized.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_12">Ultimately it&#39;s your inbox.</h4>

<ul>
<li>You make the labels you need to stay organized and informed.</li>
<li>Once something is over for the year or if you don&#39;t need a label anymore you can choose to delete all the emails or move them all to the old label.</li>
</ul>
