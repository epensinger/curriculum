# Labels for Gmail

## STRONGLY recommended
### Old
- this is for any emails before this year
- at the end of each school year/start of a new year, you should take all the previous years emails and dump them in here.
- you can still access them by searching, but they are out of the way

### Classes
- This is for any emails related to classes - class work, class information, etc.
- You don't need to make a label for each class because you can simply search by teacher
- You may make a label inside (nested) of the Classes label for any of the classes you want to.

### School Info
- This is for Announcements and school information that isn't related to a particular class
- You will put any information about your grade in here (trips, info from class oficers, etc)

### Other or Miscelaneous
- This is or stuff you want to keep that doesn't fit your other labels. 

## Optional Labels 
- you might need or want these other labels depending on your situation

### Companies
- If you find yourself keeping a lot of emails from companies, you may want to keep them in a separate label.
- I wouldn't make a separate label for each company because you can search for specific companies.

### Sports
- This label might be "Football" for you or "Soccer" or whatever you play.
- You also may want to just have one sports label and put all your sports related stuff in it.
- This is a spot for emails related to your sport - from coaches, athletic department, maybe parents? Anything to do with sports, put it here.

### Theater
- If you are involved in theater and have emails related to it, make a label so you can find them all quickly.
- Obviously, if you aren't in theater, you wouldn't have this folder.

### Robotics
- If you are in robotics, you would want to have a place for emails about it.
- If you aren't in robotics, you wouldn't need this folder.

### Other clubs/activities
- I hope you notice a pattern.  If you are in any other club or activity that you get emails about, make a label for it.
- If you are in a service or leadership group, you would want to have a label to keep all those things organized.

#### Ultimately it's your inbox.
- You make the labels you need to stay organized and informed.
- Once something is over for the year or if you don't need a label anymore you can choose to delete all the emails or move them all to the old label.
