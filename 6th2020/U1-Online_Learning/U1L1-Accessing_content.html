<li>Good online learners attend Zoom classes every day on time.</li>
<li>In this class, we will all be on zoom every day, I will use zoom instead of a projector.</li>
<li>Zettiquitte:

<ul>
<li>You should be muted unless you are instructed to answer.</li>
<li>In class you should have your video off.  If you are learning from home, there will be times to turn it on and times to turn it off.</li>
<li>If you are in class, you should turn your speakers off, if you are at home, make sure your speakers and/or headphones are on.</li>
<li>You should use the chat feature to ask questions or let the teacher know if you are having problems.</li>
<li>You should not ever say or do anything that your parents wouldn&#39;t want to see because the sessions are recorded.</li>
<li>&quot;raise your hand&quot; if you have a question.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>each of you will introduce yourself to the class in Zoom.<br></li>
<li>your introduction must include your name, the rest is up to you.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Zoomercise:

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s good to take stretch breaks during class.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_10">Screen Sharing</h3>

<ul>
<li>The last thing we need to make sure you can do on Zoom is share your screen.</li>
<li>The middle green icon says &quot;screen sharing&quot;</li>
<li>If you and your classmates don&#39;t see &quot;screen sharing&quot;, your instructor needs to allow it.</li>
<li>Open your favorite website for learning - an educational website</li>
<li>raise your hand when you are ready.</li>
<li>when I call on you, share your website.  You have 15 seconds to show us why it&#39;s cool.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_11">Zoom Chat</h3>

<ul>
<li>the zoom chat is to be used for questions and in other ways your teacher tells you.</li>
<li>the teacher may disable the chat.</li>
<li>what you say in the chat is there for everyone to see forever.</li>
