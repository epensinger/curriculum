### Taking Notes Digitally with Google Docs
- Google Docs is the word processor we use at CCS.
- Any time you want to type words Google Docs should be your first choice.
- When you take your own notes in Google Docs, you can format them anyway that you like.
- When you type something to turn in to your teacher you have to format it in the way that they like.

### From my hand to Google Docs
- You can either watch content on your screen OR take notes on your screen, but doing both is really hard.
- If you are watching your teacher from home on your screen you should take notes on paper.
- To organize paper notes in the midst of online notes, you can add them to your google drive by taking a picture.
- Taking a picture of your work on paper is a skill you need in some classes to submit work :)
- The process is: align the paper for a good photo, take the picture, save to google drive.
