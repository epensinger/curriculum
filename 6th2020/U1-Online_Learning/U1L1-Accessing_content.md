    - Links to other websites
    - Videos
    - A page explaining something you are supposed to know.
    - an embedded google doc you will complete and submit
    - a quiz with multiple choice, short answer, etc.

    - Minimize distractions.

### And now for Zoom!
- Good online learners attend Zoom classes every day on time.
- In this class, we will all be on zoom every day, I will use zoom instead of a projector.
- Zettiquitte:
    - You should be muted unless you are instructed to answer.
    - In class you should have your video off.  If you are learning from home, there will be times to turn it on and times to turn it off.
    - If you are in class, you should turn your speakers off, if you are at home, make sure your speakers and/or headphones are on.
    - You should use the chat feature to ask questions or let the teacher know if you are having problems.
    - You should not ever say or do anything that your parents wouldn't want to see because the sessions are recorded.
    - "raise your hand" if you have a question.
- Zoom Introductions:
    - each of you will introduce yourself to the class in Zoom.  
    - your introduction must include your name, the rest is up to you.
    - You have 30 seconds MAX for your introduction.
    - You may choose to speak, show us a picture, use props, etc.
- Zoomercise:
    - It's good to take stretch breaks during class.
    - I need assistant fitness instructors.
    - Think of one good stretch we can all do without leaving our desks.
    - If you want to lead us in your stretch raise your hand.  
    - If you are called on, share your screen and show us how to do your stretch.


### Screen Sharing
- The last thing we need to make sure you can do on Zoom is share your screen.
- The middle green icon says "screen sharing"
- If you and your classmates don't see "screen sharing", your instructor needs to allow it.
- Open your favorite website for learning - an educational website
- raise your hand when you are ready.
- when I call on you, share your website.  You have 15 seconds to show us why it's cool.

### Zoom Chat
- the zoom chat is to be used for questions and in other ways your teacher tells you.
- the teacher may disable the chat.
- what you say in the chat is there for everyone to see forever.
- I want each of you to open the chat and share one good thing you saw or learned in this lesson.
