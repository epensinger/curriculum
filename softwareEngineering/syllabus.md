## COURSE DESCRIPTION
### Description of course content
This course will expand on the skills you developed in Web Development and/or Computer Coding Essentials.  The end goal is for you to build a database dependent web application.  Along the way you will learn to build interactivity into websites, to write code to route http requests, and use server side logic to render customized web pages.  

### Description of learning environment
This course consists of Code Demonstrations, Exercises, Code-Alongs, Quizzes, and Projects.  It is essential that you are present, whether in class or virtually, for Code Demonstrations, Code-Alongs, and Quizzes.  I strongly recommend that all exercises are completed in class as well so that you can easily get help.  I will plan time in the schedule for you to complete most of the projects, you may need a little time outside of class time to complete them sometimes.  Whether you are attending virtually or physically, I will be using zoom to share my screen for demos and code-alongs.  You will be sharing your code on zoom to get help, or to demonstrate something you have learned.  Zoom will allow us to work together to solve problems wither we are in the same room or not. 

### GOALS
Write well documented code that follows the conventions of each language and works.
Understand how all the components of the MEN stack fit together to build a web app.
Organize code to eliminate bulk and maximize efficiency.


### What You Should Already Know
You should have taken Web Development or Computer Coding Essentials, and having taken both would set you up for the most success.
In other words you should be really comfortable with html/css OR have experience working with an interpreted high level programming language like Python or Javascript.  
You should kmnow how to type.  You need not be a full speed demon, but slow typers will struggle.
You need to be comfortable working with variables in equations.  

### Learning Outcomes>
By the end of this course, you will be able to
build interactivity into pages
script server side logic to render html pages acording to HTTP requests
Encorporate information from a database into a page


### Course Materials
You need a spiral bound notebook for this course.
You need a flash drive for file storage.

### Assignments and Grading Values>
Exercizes - 20%
Quizzes - 15%
Projects - 65%

I reserve the right to adjust those percentages if I feel that doing so would raise grades to a level that better reflects student progress.  Unforseen circumstances including but not limited to a global pandemic, significant weather event, zombie apocalypse, and civil war may require adjustments. 


### GRADING 

You may wish to include a holistic description of what excellent work looks like in your class.  I find this helpful for students who simply ask, "What do I do to make an A" vs. those who really have a desire to achieve excellence and mastery.

Discussion Board GuidelinesDo think before you post. Complete the reading or preparation work before you write.Do post your response early to give your classmates more time to reply. Check back later to see what comments have been added.Do explain your opinion and use examples to help others understand your points.Do post something that furthers the discussion and shows depth of thought. The best part of a discussion board is that you get lots of think time before you post. Use it.Do reply to several of your classmates’ posts, adding examples or asking questions.Do remember that it is harder to tell when something is a joke online. Use humor sparingly.Don’t agree with everything you read. It makes for a really boring conversation. Politely disagree when you have a difference of opinion.Don’t reply to the same people each time. Try to bring in other voices.Don’t get personal. Focus your criticism on ideas and arguments, not on your classmates.Don’t bring the outside in. No inside jokes, references to people who aren’t in the conversation, or comments you wouldn’t say face-to-face*Top Ten Discussion Board DOs and DON’Ts for Students. From Power Up: Making the Shift to 1:1 Teaching and Learning (Neebe & Roberts, 2015). Reprinted with permission.Your teacher will serve as the moderator of all discussion boards. There may be additional requirements for usage of discussion boards based on the task at hand.
