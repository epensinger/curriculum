- Javascript
- 
## Key syntaxes
- 
## Lesson Activites

## Lesson Outline
### Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack?
- The components that make up a a website can be divided into parts.
- Front End - the components that are rendered on the "client side", in the browser.  
    - These files are sent from the server to the browser and tell the browser what to display and how it should look.
    - HTML - Page Structure (Required)
    - CSS - Page Style (everyone does it)
    - Javascript - Interactivity (optional)
    - jQuery - a tool that is used 
    - Javascript Frameworks - A set of pre-written code you can use to add common features to your work.
        Ex - React, Vue, Angular (less essential, but very common)
