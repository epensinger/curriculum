<h3 id="toc_6">Finding Coding Careers on O-net</h3>

<ul>
<li>O-net is a tool used by career counselors and other folks to get a big picture of what various careers and jobs might be like.</li>
<li>Find Careers: Type javascript in the search box at the top left.  Make sure to click <code>show all occupations</code> at the bottom.</li>
<li>Read about the careers that most interest you, and some you may never have heard of.</li>
<li>Each listing compiles information from many different listings - no one role would require all of those parts but all of those parts are required for some job with that title somewhere.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_7">Select most interesting jobs</h3>

<ul>
<li>List 3 jobs that sound most interesting to you based on the tasks for those jobs.  You will need that list for the assignment at the end.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_8">HTML Demo</h3>

<ul>
<li>HTML is the language of the internet - lots of stuff may happen as it is rendered, but ultimately what you see is rendered into html.</li>
<li>I will show you how to structure a page in HTML using VS Code.</li>
<li>You will need to use the html boilerplate, headings, sections, and lists in your next assignment so write them down if they are unfamiliar to you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_9">Coding Jobs Webpage</h3>

<ul>
<li>See Assignment for instructions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_10">P.S. A note about HTML</h3>

<p>If you are rusty or not familiar with HTML you do not need to memorize it for this unit.  You need to be able to use it, but you can refer to your notebook or other sources along the way.  By the end of this course you will have had plenty of practice with it.  If you want some extra practice, codecademy&#39;s free HTML course is a great option.</p>
