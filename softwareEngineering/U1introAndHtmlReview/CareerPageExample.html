            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I chose this career because I have always dreamed of designing software solutions for five year olds.  Life is hard for five year olds and I think they should have the best apps.  I also noticed that the median salary is $200,000.  I want to be rich. And help kids, that too.</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I chose this career because animals also should have the best apps.  I think this job would be a good second choice for me because it would help me build my skills until I can get my dream job of designing apps for animals.  Animal app designers have to spend time living with animals to design interfaces specifically for each species and I have always wanted to live at a zoo.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I chose this career because I am tired of writing fake example paragraphs for my fake example project.  I am looking forward to reading your paragraphs because it will help me get to know you and your interests a little better.  I hope that you put more effort into crafting your sentences than I have put into writing this example.</p>
