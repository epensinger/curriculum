## Lesson Outline
### Mozilla Developer Network
- while you can google everything, sometimes Googling takes longer than simply refering to a trusted reference.
- the mozilla developer network is currently the most reliable and up to date reference for HTML, CSS, and front end Javascript.
- they have tutorials for various levels as well as reference guides for when you mostly remember something and need a refresher.

### HTML Forms
- Html forms are used to collect user input and send it back to the server.
- HTML forms have a couple of attributes at the top that are really important
    - #### Method
        - defines which HTTP method to send the data with (usually get or post).
        
    - #### Action
        - defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
- in later units you will be working with how to recieve the data and do something with it, but for now, we are just looking at how a form is built.

### HTML Form Tutorial
- Using the [Your First Form Tutorial] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form), make a form.  
- The goal here is that you get familiar with using MDN as a reference to expand your capabilities.  
- And also that you have some experience putting a form together.
- Following the instructions, build a form.
- You do NOT need to style this form at this time.  If you have time and want to mess with it, make sure you are putting the styles into a separate .css file.
