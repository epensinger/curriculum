<h1 id="toc_0">Intro and HTML Review</h1>

<p>In this unit you will explore different careers for computer programmers, the various technologies that are used in different roles in different contexts, and where the technologies in this course fit into that larger picture.
We will also do a crash course in using HTML tags.  HTML will keep popping up as we go, but it&#39;s not a key learning goal for this course.  It&#39;s more about doing things with HTML documents than it is about spewing out HTML for HTML&#39;s sake.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What are the big ideas for this unit?</h2>

<ul>
<li>HTML tags are used to identify the structure of a document for browsers to interpret.</li>
<li>The field of software engineering includes many technologies and roles, and languages and technologies fit together in varoius ways in various contexts. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">What are the big questions I should be thinking about?</h2>

<ul>
<li>What do Software Engineers do?</li>
<li>What technologies do companies use?</li>
<li>Where does what we are learning fit in the big picture?</li>
<li>How is HTML used to give structure to text?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">What is the final project for this unit?</h2>

<p>You will be creating two HTML pages in this unit.  One about careers, and the other about technologies.  You will be using these pages in the next unit as we talk about how styles are added to HTML documents.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Where can I look if I want to learn more / get help with the content of this unit?</h2>
