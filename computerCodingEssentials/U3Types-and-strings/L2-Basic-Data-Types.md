# Basic Data Types
In this lesson you will learn how data is classified into different types in Python.  You won't learn to use all of them, but you will learn to recognize them.
## Lesson Goals
- Describe basic data types in python
- Identify basic data types in python
## Key Terms to pay attention to
- boolean
- integer
- float
- string
- list
- brackets
- dictionary
- curly braces
## Key syntaxes
- True, False
- ""
- []
- {}
## Lesson Activites
- Data Types Table
- Data types demo
- Data Types exercise
- Data types quiz
## Lesson Outline
### Booleans
- stored as one bite on the disk - a 1 or 0.
- MUST start with a capital in python - True or False
- can be evaluated by the computer or declared
### Integers and floating point
- see numbers unit
- space is allocated differently, two different types
- 5.0 does NOT equal 5
### String
- a sequence of Unicode characters set in quotes
- quotes may be single or double <code>"Hello there"</code> = <code> 'Hello there'</code>
### The special value None
- you can use None for any variable to declare that it exists but is empty.
- saves you from errors when you want to run code but a value may not have been entered yet.
- <code>age = None</code>
### Data Structures
- the following data types (lists and dictionaries), are data structures - data types that hold and organize other data types.
- each of these has their own unit coming later, but for now, be able to identify them by their syntax.
### List
- lists are ordered sequences of values enclosed in brackets <code>[]</code>.  Each value is separated by a comma.
- <code>[1,3,5,3,5]</code>
- <code>["a", "b", "four", "hello"]</code>
- <code>[a_variable, another_variable, a_number, a_string, whatever]</code>
### Dict
- stands for dictionary
- set of key and value pairs enclosed in curly braces <code>{}</code> and divided by commas.
- <code>{"key":"value", "another key":"another value"}</code>
- <code>{"name": variable, "age": 15, "class": another_variable}</code>
### Dynamic Typing
- in Python, you can change the type of variables during the course of the program simply by putting a different type in them somewhere in your code.  This is called Dynamic Typing.
- other languages are static typed - variables are typed at the start of the program and can't change type while the program is running.
- Examples of Dynamically typed languages - Python, Ruby, Javascript
- Examples of Statically typed languages - C, C++, Java, Haskell
