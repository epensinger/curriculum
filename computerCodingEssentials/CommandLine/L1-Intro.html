<h2>Lesson Outline</h2>

<h3>What is the Command Line?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>the command line is a faster and more powerful way to maneuver around the operating system.</li>
	<li>it replaces things you do with the graphical user interface (GUI) and gives you more power.</li>
	<li>you give instructions to the computer using special keywords</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I find the command line?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>on Repl.it (in a repl) type <code>f1</code> then type &quot;open shell&quot; and hit enter.</li>
	<li>on a Mac open terminal</li>
	<li>in a chromebook do this: https://www.techjunkie.com/how-to-access-the-command-prompt-on-a-chromebook/ (it will be limited)</li>
	<li>on a PC follow these instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skypeforbusiness/set-up-your-computer-for-windows-powershell/download-and-install-windows-powershell-5-1 (it&#39;s going to be different)</li>
</ul>

<h3>OS File Structure</h3>

<ul>
	<li>operating systems organize their folders in a heirarchy (a file tree)</li>
	<li>all files and folders are organized relative to the base root directory.</li>
	<li>the base root directory is the very top level on a hard disk or container (if working on a cloud environment)</li>
	<li>folders are nested inside a parent and the folders inside them are their child directories.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Absolute Paths</h3>

<ul>
	<li>absolute paths are the location of a file or directory from the root.</li>
	<li>Each directory in a path is indicated with a slash</li>
	<li>example: /Users/me/Documents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where am I?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>use <code>pwd</code> to print the working directory</li>
	<li>will print the absolute path of where you currently are to the screen</li>
	<li>When you open the command line it will start at the home directory by default.</li>
	<li>This is also designated by <code> ~ </code> that's called a tilde</li>
</ul>

<h3>Listing files and directories</h3>

<ul>
	<li>use <code>ls</code> to list the files and folders in the current directory.</li>
	<li>flags let you give more specfic instructions with a keyword</li>
	<li>use the flag <code>-a</code> which means all like this: <code>ls -a</code> to list all the files and directories in a directory.</li>
	<li>this shows the hidden files that live in a directory but are hidden by default</li>
	<li>generally those are the files that would break something if you mess with them.</li>
	<li>use the flag <code>-l</code> to list the long version of the files like this: <code>ls -l</code>. That will show permissions, the last modified timestamp, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Moving to a different working directory</h3>

<ul>
	<li>use cd to change the working directory</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li><h4>Relative naviagation</h4>

<ul>
	<li>if I&#39;m in a directory that has a child directory called stuff in it I can navigate to stuff by typing <code>cd stuff</code></li>
	<li>if there&#39;s a child directory of stuff called games I could navigate there directy with <code>cd stuff/games</code> or I could navigate to stuff with <code>cd stuff</code> and then <code>cd games</code></li>
	<li>to navigate from a child directory to a parent I can use <code>cd ..</code>, the two dots represent the parent. I could go up two parents with <code>cd ../.. </code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

	<li><h4>Absolute navigation</h4>


<ul>
	<li>if I want to go directly to a location regardless of where I am, I can type it&#39;s absolute path, staring from the route.</li>
	<li>for example: <code>cd /Users/me/Documents/stuff/games </code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h4>Summary:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Use <code>cd</code> to move around between directions either relatively or absolutely. Use <code>pwd</code> to print the working directory when you get lost, and <code>ls</code> to list the directories and files when you forget where you are going.</li>
</ul>
