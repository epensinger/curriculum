# Command Line Lesson 2 - Creating with the Command Line
In this lesson you will learn to use the command line to create files and directories
## Lesson Goals
- Create new directories using the command line
- Create new files inside directories
- Correctly add extensions to files of common types
## Key Terms to pay attention to
- extensions
## Key syntaxes
- mkdir
- touch
## Lesson Activites
- Creating files and directories code along
- file extensions scavenger hunt
- Animals group zoom activity
- Creating quiz
## Lesson Outline
### Making Directories with mkdir
- the command <code>mkdir</code> followed by the name of the new directory will create a new child directory inside the current directory
- ex: <code>mkdir Stuff</code> creates a directory called Stuff.
- ex: <code>mkdir Stuff/games</code> creates a directory called games inside Stuff (you could also change to Stuff and then create games)
### Creating files with touch
- the command <code>touch</code> followed by the filename, a dot, and the file type extension will create a new empty file of that type in the working directory.
- ex <code>touch readme.txt </code> would create a text file called readme inside the working directory.
- touch does not overwrite files if they exist.  
- the created files are empty.
### File Extensions
- file extensions tell the os what kind file it is and how it can be used.
- all files on the computer must have an extension to work properly.
- changing the extension DOES NOT change anything about what is in the file, only how the computer will try to use it
- to change the kind of file you have to modify the contents of the file - use a converter, export it differently, etc.
### Animals Activity
- this is an in class activity, you will be asked to create folders and files.
- this is not a submittable project, but it's important that you do know how to create directories and files.
