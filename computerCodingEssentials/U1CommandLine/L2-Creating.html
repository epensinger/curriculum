</ul>

<h2>Lesson Outline</h2>

<h3>Making Directories with mkdir</h3>

<ul>
	<li>the command <code>mkdir</code> followed by the name of the new directory will create a new child directory inside the current directory</li>
	<li>ex: <code>mkdir Stuff</code> creates a directory called Stuff.</li>
	<li>ex: <code>mkdir Stuff/games</code> creates a directory called games inside Stuff (you could also change to Stuff and then create games)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating files with touch</h3>

<ul>
	<li>the command <code>touch</code> followed by the filename, a dot, and the file type extension will create a new empty file of that type in the working directory.</li>
	<li>ex <code>touch readme.txt </code> would create a text file called readme inside the working directory.</li>
	<li>touch does not overwrite files if they exist. </li>
	<li>the created files are empty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>File Extensions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>file extensions tell the os what kind file it is and how it can be used.</li>
	<li>all files on the computer must have an extension to work properly.</li>
	<li>changing the extension DOES NOT change anything about what is in the file, only how the computer will try to use it</li>
	<li>to change the kind of file you have to modify the contents of the file - use a converter, export it differently, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Animals Activity</h3>

<ul>
	<li>this is an in class activity, you will be asked to create folders and files.</li>
	<li>this is not a submittable project, but it&#39;s important that you do know how to create directories and files.</li>
</ul>
