# Lesson 2 Operators
In this lesson students will learn how to code mathematical equations in python.
## Lesson Goals
- Use the 7 mathematical operators in python
## Key Terms to pay attention to
- exponentiation
- modulo
- integer division
## Key syntaxes
- +
- -
- *
- /
- **
- %
- //
## Lesson Activites
- Basic mathematical operators demo
- Mathematical operators table
- Basic operators quiz
- Complex operators demo
- Complex operators quiz
## Lesson Outline
### Addition
- Use <code>+</code> to add two numbers together.
- As we learned before, if you add a float and a float or a float and an int the result will always be a float.  Python will keep .0 on the end.
### Subtraction
- Use <code>-</code> to subtract.
- As in addition, if either number is a float, it will return a float.
### Multiplication
- Use <code>*</code> to multiply.
- x is a letter in python, it can't also be an operator!
- Once again, if either of the numbers is a float, the result will also be a float.
### Division
- Use <code>/</code> to divide.
- Division will always return a float
- Division that results in a repeating decimal will print 16 places and quit.
#### The first quiz is over this much
### Exponentiation
- Use <code>**</code> to create an exponent.  
- <code>2**3</code> is read "two to the third" and evaluates to 8 (2*2*2)
- <code>3**2</code> is read "thre squared" and evaluates to 9 (3*3)
### Modulo
- Use <code>%</code> to find the modulo
- The modulo is the remainder after one number is divided by another number
- <code>5 % 2</code> returns 1
- <code>12 % 5</code> returns 2
- <code>22 % 5</code> also returns 2
- Useful for idenfiying whether a number is odd or even, or finding every 3rd, etc.
### Integer Division
- Use <code>//</code> for integer division
- Integer division always returns an integer
- If the result isn't a whole number, the decimal portion is chopped off. 
- Not highly used, but helpful for converting float to int, or along with the modulo.
