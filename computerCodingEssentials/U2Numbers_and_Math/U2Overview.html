<h1 id="toc_0">Numbers and Math</h1>

<p>In this unit you will learn about the Mathematical Operators you can use in Python.  You will learn how to feed Python a math problem and get the result you expect.  You will also learn the two ways that Python stores numbers in memory and when to use each.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What are the big ideas for this unit?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The 2 main data types of numbers in python.</li>
<li>Coding mathematical equations in python.</li>
<li>Following the order of operations to write equations with more than one operator.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_2">What big questions should I be thinking about?</h2>

<ul>
<li>What&#39;s the difference between floats and ints and when does it matter?</li>
<li>What are the mathematical operators in python and how do I use them?</li>
<li>In what order does python solve mathematical equations?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">What will we be doing in this unit?</h2>

<ul>
<li>We will be doing math in the python interpreter</li>
<li>There will be quizzes and some activities</li>
<li>We won&#39;t be writing files yet, just working in the interpreter, so no big projects yet.</li>
</ul>
