# Numbers and Math
In this unit you will learn about the Mathematical Operators you can use in Python.  You will learn how to feed Python a math problem and get the result you expect.  You will also learn the two ways that Python stores numbers in memory and when to use each.

## What are the big ideas for this unit?
- The 2 main data types of numbers in python.
- Coding mathematical equations in python.
- Following the order of operations to write equations with more than one operator.

## What big questions should I be thinking about?
- What's the difference between floats and ints and when does it matter?
- What are the mathematical operators in python and how do I use them?
- In what order does python solve mathematical equations?

## What will we be doing in this unit?
- We will be doing math in the python interpreter
- There will be quizzes and some activities
- We won't be writing files yet, just working in the interpreter, so no big projects yet.
