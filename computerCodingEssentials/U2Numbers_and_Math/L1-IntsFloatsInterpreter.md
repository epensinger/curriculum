# Ints, Floats, and the Interpreter
In this lesson you will learn the 2 main data types of numbers in python, and also how to turn your command line into a calculator.
## Lesson Goals
- Use the python interpreter in the command line to perform mathematical operations
- classify numbers as either floats or ints
- understand the difference between floats and ints
## Key Terms to pay attention to
- data types
- float
- int
## Key syntaxes
- python3
## Lesson Activites
- Demo and Code along
- Quiz
## Lesson Outline
### Data Types
- In python (and all programming languages I can think of) when we store data, it is classified as a certain type of data.
- This lets the computer know how much space it will take up in the memory and how it can (and can't) be used.
### Integers
- Integers are whole numbers with no decimal parts in them.
- in python their type is called int
- any whole number (negative or positive) is an int.
### Floats
- Float is short for floating point number.  It refers to the way the data is converted to data and stored.
- Floats are numbers that have decimals.  
- Floats must be stored differently than integers in the data because they can have more digits.
- ex:  5.0, 4.354234, 3.14, 2.3333333, 0.0, -4.23
- if any of the numbers in your calculation are floats the answer will be a float
- ex: <code>float + int = float</code>
- ex: <code>float + float = float</code>
- ex: <code>int + int = int</code>
- ex: <code>1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0</code> (still a float)
### The Interpreter
- IF python3 is on your computer, type <code>python3</code> in the command line to launch the python interpreter
- the Interpreter displays the result of python commands and is interactive
- It's not JUST a calculator, but it does work like one.
